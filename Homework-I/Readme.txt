Hi TA/ Grader
Firstly to clarify why there are many pictures-
I have added many photographs for all the data we had to load consulting a TA about it that it is 
Good to add various angles and views.
So there are multiple, views of each “GrandTeton-256-HF.jpg”, “OhioPyle-256-HF.jpg”, “SantaMonicaMountains-256-HF.jpg”


For Extra Credits and Artistic-
For The extra credits and Artistic part I have done the complete process on My personal photograph edited it in Photoshop before using that, loaded it in colors as well, that can be seen in the video attached as extra credits, for printing that I am using only 2D point system as it was looking better. I have also implemented the Animation that professor talked about in the class the spinning cube one on Idle, and Rendered WireFrame as well in the extra credits key-bind to 4, and the RGB image key-bind to 5.
