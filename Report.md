### The project requires to create a graph and perform mapping computations out of ~20000 coordinates located around the area of University of Southern California. Run various algorithms on it like

- Autocomplete
- Find Location
- Find Closest Name & Calculate Edit Distance
- Get all categories
- Get all locations of category 
- Get location matching regular expression 
- Calculate Shortest Path
- Cycle Detection                                          
- Topological Sort
- Traveling salesman problem 
  - Brute Force Algorithm
  - BackTracking Algorithm
  - 2-opt Algorithm
  - 3-opt Algorithm
